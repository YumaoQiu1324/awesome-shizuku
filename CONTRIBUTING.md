## Contributing

Thank you for contributing to this project!

Please try to preserve the following format:
- Additions are inserted preserving alphabetical order
- Format your submission as follows:
  - Format: ``* [Name](https://example.com) - Short description, under 250 characters `License` [(Source code)](https://url.of/source-code)``
  - Keep the short description under 250 characters.
  - Add the project's corresponding [SPDX license identifier](https://spdx.org/licenses/), for example `GPL-3.0` or `Apache-2.0`. If SPDX does not cover the license or the project has no license, then the project will be listed as `Proprietary`.
  - Do not add a duplicate Source code link if it is the same as the main link.
  - Add matching tags between the name and description:
    - `Paid` ðŸ’° - Paid application
    - `IAP` ðŸ’° - Contains in-app purchases
    - `Ads` - Contains ads
    - `n-day trial` - Payment required after n days. Replace `n` with the number of days.
    - `Root` - Requires Shizuku to run in Root mode
- To keep the main list clean, please put projects that do not meet the following requirements into [UNLISTED.md](pages/UNLISTED.md) instead of the main list:
  - Project must have an English landing page, readme, or documentation
  - Project must not be deprecated by the developer
  - Project must provide some kind of download link for the app (APK file, Play Store, F-Droid, ...)


Automated changelog:
* A changelog (sorted by date) is automatically generated and published here: https://github.com/timschneeb/changelog-awesome-shizuku
* Its main focus is to allow people to track new additions to the list more easily.
* To prevent changes from appearing in that changelog, you can add \[silent] into your commit message. **This should be done for grammar fixes, category changes, URL updates, and other minor adjustments.** Without \[silent], changes to existing items would bump them to the top on the changelog, which might not be desirable.

Pushing your changes:
- To add a new entry, [edit the README.md file](https://github.com/ThePBone/awesome-shizuku/edit/master/README.md) through Github's web interface or a text editor, and send a Pull Request.
- See [Editing files in another user's repository](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/), [Creating Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/), [Using Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) for help on sending your patch.
